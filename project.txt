<----vh---->
The size of the screen in terms of vh (viewport height) is a CSS unit that represents a percentage of the viewport's height. Here's how it works:

1vh equals 1% of the viewport's height. So, if your screen height is 800 pixels, 1vh would be 8 pixels.
100vh means 100% of the viewport height, so it will cover the entire height of the screen.

<---- vw ---->
vw (viewport width) is a CSS unit that represents a percentage of the viewport's width, similar to how vh works for height.

1vw equals 1% of the viewport's width. So, if the screen width is 1200 pixels, 1vw would be 12 pixels.
100vw covers the entire width of the viewport.

<--- min height --->
Whenever we provide minmum height to a element then its children are restricted to take any thing in %
